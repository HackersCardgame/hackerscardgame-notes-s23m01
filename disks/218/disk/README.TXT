What is PacketCD ?
==================
	PacketCD is the first software product realizing the 
	latest version of the OSTA UDF standard (1.50) for 
	file-systems on CD-Recordable media for Windows 95.
	This file-system was designed to be integrated seam-
	lessly into the operating system of your computer. 
	After you have formatted an empty CD-R this disc 
	becomes available as a Windows 95 volume and can be 
	used almost like a harddisk or a floppy.
	If you want to use the disc on another computer you 
	need to prepare the disc for use in normal CD-ROM drives.

What is OSTA UDF ?
==================
	OSTA UDF stands for Optical Storage Technology Association 
	Universal Disc Format. The OSTA is a group of hardware and 
	software vendors (including CeQuadrat) who have adopted 
	the ISO 13346 standard for DVD, CD-R and CD-RW applica-
	tions. The current version of the OSTA UDF standard is 
	version 1.50 which is supported by this implementation of 
	PacketCD.

Installation
============
	After you have inserted the PacketCD floppy into your 
	floppy disk drive start 'Add/Remove Programs' from the 
	Control Panel. Press the 'Install' button and follow the 
	instructions on the screen.
	After the system has rebooted you can use your CD Recorder 
	like any other drive in your system.
	To remove PacketCD from your system select 'CeQuadrat 
	PacketCD' from the list of installed programs and click 
	'Add/Remove'.

	Although PacketCD works with 'Auto Insert Notification' 
	switched off, you will get better usability if this option 
	is on.

Supported Devices
=================
	CeQuadrat wants to support as many CD-R devices as possible.
	In the future we plan to support all devices which can 
	support the so called 'Incremental Packet Writing' mode.
	If you encounter problems with a drive listed below please 
	make sure you are using the latest firmware available for 
	this drive as 'IPW' is a relatively new technology and only 
	the latest firmware guarantees success in using PacketCD 
	with your Recorder.

	of the above mentioned please contact support.


Troubleshooting
===============
	It was not possible for us to check with all possible 
	configurations of Windows 95 systems. Therefore, if 
	you encounter problems with your PC that aroused after 
	PacketCD has been installed on you computer please try 
	to send us a detailed description of all hardware and 
	software installed on your system.
	Especially system extensions like system monitors or 
	additional caches are potential candidates for problems.

	Directly after a writing session the disc remains locked 
	for a few seconds (typically 15). After this time the
	disc is 'clean' and can be removed from the drive either
	by using 'eject' from the drives context menu or simply
	by pressing the drive's eject button.
