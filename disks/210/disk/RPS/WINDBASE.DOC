                                INTRODUCTION

     Windbase is an application that was designed to help simplify data 
collection, storage and retrieval.  With the help of Windbase, you can 
design custom data entry forms and at the same time create the database 
to match it.  Windbase will also allow you to index and reindex your data 
by a single field or multiple fields.  This enables you to organize and 
retrieve your data much more easily and faster as well.  WindBase also 
allows you to create, store and view multiple database files all at the 
same time.  Then when you are ready to print your data, WindBase will 
print it in the same custom layout or let you reorganize the data to best 
fit your needs.

                            GETTING STARTED

          REQUIREMENTS -
               Microsoft Windows 3.0 or higher
               IBM compatible PC 286, 386 or 486

     Before proceeding, make sure that you have Microsoft Windows correctly 
installed.  Next create a directory called WINDBASE and copy the WindBase 
software (WINDBASE.EXE) into this directory.  WindBase is ready to be 
started.  Simply start WindBase from the RUN... menu selection of the 
Windows Program Manager or add it to a Program Manager group by following 
the directions for creating a group item in the Windows 3.0 User's Guide.


                            WHAT IS A DATABASE

     A database is a collection of similar data records stored in a common 
file or collection of files.  A database management system such as WindBase 
provides a means by which a user can easily store and retrieve this data.


     CREATING A NEW DATABASE

     To create a WindBase database first select NEW from the FILE pulldown 
menu.  WindBase will create a blank database definition window and ungray 
the following menu selections:

     FILE Menu:
        
        SAVE DEFINITION - Create or save a database definition and data files.
        
     DEFINE Menu:

        TEXT - This option creates a static text field in the current 
               database definition window.
        
        EDIT - This option creates an entry/edit field in the current 
               database definition window.
        
        CHECKBOX - This option creates a checkbox in the current database 
                   definition window.
        
        STYLES - This option displays a popup window that allows the user 
                 to modify the attributes of the currently selected TEXT, 
                 EDIT or CHECKBOX field. 
        
        DELETE - This option deletes the currently selected TEXT, EDIT or 
                 CHECKBOX field.
        
        TITLE - This option modifies the database title that appears in the 
                database window.
        
        
     Layout the database by selecting database fields from the DEFINE 
pulldown menu as described in the CREATING A DATABASE FIELD section.  Each 
of the newly created fields can be resized and placed in the database 
definition window where desired.
     After all of the database fields have been created and defined, the 
database layout can be save and the database files created.  To do this, 
simply select SAVE DEFINITION from the FILE pulldown menu.  A SAVE FILE 
popup window will appear prompting the user to enter a path and file name 
where the database files and associated layout files will be stored.  The 
user only needs to enter the primary part of the file name (file name 
without the extension).  WindBase will add the extension of .WB for the 
database layout file, .DB for the database file and .IDX for the index file.  Once the file name has been entered and the user has selected the SAVE pushbutton, the database definition and field layout files will be created.  If the database files already exist in the specified path, Windbase will notify the user that the database already exists and the path or file name must to be changed.  Once a database definition has been saved and the database created, WindBase will only allow the database fields to b
e resized or repositioned.  No new database fields can be created.

CREATING A DATABASE FIELD

     By selecting the TEXT, EDIT or CHECKBOX options from the DEFINE 
pulldown menu, the corresponding field will be created in the currently 
selected database definition window.  The new field will be created in the 
upper left hand corner of the database definition window.  A style popup 
window will be displayed prompting the user to enter a name to identify the 
newly created field and modify any of the field attributes if desired.  
After the database field has been created, it can be moved and resized 
as explained in the MOVE AND RESIZEING A DATABASE FIELD section.

SETTING ATTRIBUTES OF A DATABASE FIELD

     Each TEXT, EDIT and CHECKBOX field defaults to a specific set of 
attributes.  These attributes may be modified through the STYLES option in 
the DEFINE pulldown menu.  When the STYLES option is selected a popup 
window is presented that corresponds to the selected database field.  The 
EDIT and CHECKBOX fields require a field name that is later used in the 
creation of the database.  All other attributes in the styles dialog boxes 
are optional.

MOVING AND RESIZING A DATABASE FIELD

     Once a database field has been created, it can be moved or resized to 
the desired position and size by dragging and dropping with the mouse 
pointer or grabbing the field border and stretching it.
     To move the field, simply place the mouse pointer over the top of it 
and click the mouse button once.  A dotted line will appear around the field 
to indicate that it is now the currently selected field.  The mouse pointer 
will also change to a four direction pointer to indicate that the field 
may be moved.  With the four direction pointer over the top of the selected 
field, press and hold the left mouse button down and while hold down the 
button, move the mouse pointer to the desired position.  A database field 
may also be moved by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.  To do this 
first select the database field with the mouse as described above.  Then 
use the arrow keys to move the database field in the desired direction.
     To resize a database field, select the field as described above, then 
move the mouse pointer over the top of the border of the selected field.  
As this is done, the mouse pointer will change from a four direction pointer 
to a two direction horizontal, vertical or diagonal pointer depending on 
the direction in which the field may be resized.  Then simply hold the left 
mouse button down and move the mouse in the direction indicated by the two 
direction pointer until the field is resized to the desired size.

DELETING A DATABASE FIELD

     Once a TEXT, EDIT and CHECKBOX field has been created, it may be 
deleted.  To delete a field, simply select it by placing the mouse pointer 
over it and pressing the left mouse button.  Once the field has been 
selected, a dotted line border will appear around it.  Then select DELETE 
from the DEFINE pulldown menu.  A confirmation dialog box will appear 
asking that the user to confirm the operation.  Selecting the YES 
pushbutton, will delete the field.

CHANGING THE DATABASE TITLE

     To change the title that appears in the database window title bar, 
select the TITLE option from the DEFINE pulldown menu.  After making this 
selection a dialog box will be displayed allowing the user to enter a 
database title.  After entering the database title, select the OK pushbutton 
and the database window title will change.

OPENING A DATABASE

     To open an existing database the user must select OPEN from the FILE 
pulldown menu.  An open file popup window will be displayed.  This popup 
window allows the user to change directories and select database files.  
There are four types of files that WindBase creates.  The primary name of 
each of the four files of a database is the name specified by the user when 
the database was originally created.  The extensions for each of these 
files are as follows:

     .WB - WindBase database layout file.
     .DB - Database file.
     .IDX -Database index file.
     .PRN -WindBase page layout file.

     When opening a database, any one of these files can be selected.  
Once the database has been selected, a database window will appear with 
the current database layout.
     The open file dialog also allows the user to open a database 
definition window for modification.  This is done by checking  the 
DATABASE DEFINITION checkbox before clicking on the OPEN pushbutton.  A 
database definition that has been opened for modification can not have 
new database fields created.  The only modifications that are allowed 
are resizing and repositioning of existing database fields.  Once all of 
the modifications have been completed, select SAVE DEFINITION from the 
FILE pulldown menu.

DELETING A DATABASE
     To delete a database the user must open the database as described 
in the OPENING A DATABASE section.  Once the database has been opened and 
selected, pull down the FILE menu and select DELETE.  A confirmation popup 
window will appear allowing the user to confirm the action.  If the OK 
pushbutton is selected, the database along with its associated files will 
be deleted.

ENTERING AND EDITING DATA

     To enter and edit a record within a database the user must first open 
the database as described in the OPENING A DATABASE section.  Data can be 
entered into any of the EDIT fields or CHECKBOXes.  Once the desired data 
has been entered, select ADD from the RECORD pulldown menu.  This will add 
the record to the database.
     Modifying a record can be done in the same manner.  After the data 
has been completely modified, select MODIFY from the RECORD pulldown menu.  

MOVING AROUND A DATABASE

     Searching and browsing through the records of a database can be done 
by selecting SEARCH, PREVIOUS and NEXT from the RECORD pulldown menu.  To 
search for a specific record, simply enter in the data or part of the data 
into the field by which the database has been indexed.  Then select SEARCH 
from the RECORD pulldown menu.  WindBase will search the database for the 
first record that exactly matches or is the closest match the data entered.  
By selecting the NEXT or PREVIOUS options from the RECORD pulldown menu, 
the user will be able to step through each record one by one forward or 
backward.

DELETING A RECORD FROM THE DATABASE

     To delete a record from the database, simply select the record in the 
same manor as described in the MOVING THROUGH THE DATA RECORDS section.  
Once the desired record has been selected pull down the RECORD menu and 
click on the DELETE option.  A confirmation popup window will appear 
allowing the user to confirm or reject the action.  If the user clicks on 
the YES pushbutton, the record will be deleted from the databases.

DEFINING AN INDEX

     One of the selections under the FILE pulldown menu is the option to 
define or set a new default INDEX for a database.  After selecting this 
option, a popup window will appear that contains two list boxes.  The first 
list box on the left contains a list of the currently defined indexes for 
the selected database.  By highlighting one of the index names in the list 
box, the name will appear in the entry field at the top right-hand side of 
the popup window.  The second list box will display a list of the fields 
currently defined in the selected database with the selected index 
definition fields highlighted.
     A new index can be created by first entering in a new index name into 
the INDEX NAME entry field above the INDEX DEFINITION list box.  Then by 
dragging and placing the database field names within the INDEX DEFINITION 
list box into the desired order and highlighting them by click on them with 
the mouse, the user is able to define a new index definition.  After the 
new index has been defined, click on the DEFINE pushbutton beneath the 
INDEX DEFINITION list box and the index will be created and added to the 
current database index list.  Once an index has been defined, it can not 
be modified or deleted.  The only way to remove index definitions is by 
selecting the REINDEX option from the FILE/INDEX cascade menu.  This option 
will remove all of the defined indexes and recreate the PHYSICAL and PRIMARY 
indexes.

REINDEXING A DATABASE

     To reindex a database, first open the database as described in the 
OPENING A DATABASE section.  Once the database has been opened and the 
database window selected, pulldown the FILE menu and select REINDEX from 
the INDEX cascade menu.  This will remove all of the currently defined 
indexes for the selected database and restore the base PHYSICAL and PRIMARY 
indexes.  

LAYING OUT A PRINTER PAGE

     WindBase allows the user to print a database record in a different 
format than what was originally laid out.  Creating a printer page layout 
is similar to creating a laying out a database.  Select PAGE SETUP from 
the FILE pulldown menu.  A database window will appear with the current 
page layout.  When the page layout window is created, the working area is 
adjusted to reflect the current size of a physical printer page according 
to the printer definition.  The working area can be scrolled within the 
page layout window by using the scroll bars along the sides of the window.  
If the printer page layout has not already been created, it will default 
to the current database layout.  The database fields can be moved and 
resized as described in the MOVING AND RESIZING A DATABASE FIELD section.  
While in the printer page layout mode the user will not be able to create 
new EDIT or CHECKBOX fields, but the user may create new TEXT fields.  The 
user is also allowed to change the text of a CHECKBOX or any previously 
exiting TEXT field.    Once the printer page has been laid out as desired, 
select SAVE DEFINITION from the FILE pulldown menu.  The printer page 
layout will be saved and used whenever a record is printed from the 
corresponding database.

PRINTING A RECORD

     To print a record, first select the desired record as described in the 
MOVING AROUND THE DATABASE section.  After the desired record has be 
selected, pulldown the FILE menu and select PRINT.  The current record 
will be printed using the previously defined printer page layout.  (The 
printer page layout must have been previously defined as described in the 
LAYING OUT A PRINTER PAGE section.).

VIEWING A MANIPULATING MULTIPLE DATABASES

     Because WindBase was implemented as a multiple document interface 
application, it allows the user to open, maintain and view more the one 
database at a time.  As each database file is opened, WindBase creates a 
new database window and lays out the database on the working area.  
Switching from one database to another is as simple as placing the mouse 
cursor over the desired window and clicking the left mouse button.  This 
will select that database and window as the current database.  All of the 
WindBase menu options will then apply to that database.  Each of the 
database windows can also be minimized to avoid cluttering up the desktop 
with too many windows.  Then, as desired, each database window can be 
restored or minimized as the user moves from one database file to another.

     DRAG AND DROP - Whenever an item such as a database field is being 
repositioned within a database definition window , the item may be dragged 
and dropped.  This means that an item can be selected with the mouse 
pointer, and while holding the mouse button down, move the pointer to a 
new position.  When the mouse button is released the selected item will 
be placed at the mouse pointer position.

     CLIPBOARD - The clipboard is a convenient way of transferring data 
between WindBase and other Windows applications or between different 
Windbase databases or records.  To use the clipboard functions simply 
highlight any text that is displayed in an entry field, pull down the 
EDIT menu and choose COPY or CUT.  The COPY function will place a copy 
of the highlighted text in the Windows clipboard.  The CUT function also 
places the highlighted text in the clipboard but also removes it from the 
entry field.  To retrieve text from the clipboard, place the cursor at the 
position inside an entry field where the clipboard text should be inserted 
or appended.  Then pull down the EDIT menu and choose PASTE.  The clipboard 
text will be placed in the entry field at the cursor position.


                                   EXITING

     When you have finished using WindBase, you should exit via the EXIT 
selection from the main window's FILE menu.  If you forget and turn your 
computer off before exiting, WindBase can not guarantee that your database 
files have been saved completely.  It is very important that you always 
exit WindBase via this selection.
