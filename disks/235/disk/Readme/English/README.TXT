This floppy diskette contains important software updates and additional drive
support that were added after the CD was manufactured.  Please insert this
floppy when prompted too by the setup program on the CD.

There are some users that cannot easily hook up both a floppy drive and
a CD-ROM drive at the same time.  For example, perhaps you have a laptop that
can use a floppy drive or CD-ROM drive, but cannot have both installed at the
same time.  If you experience this difficulty, you can follow these steps:

1.)  Connect your floppy drive
2.)  Create a temporary folder on your hard drive.  For example, c:\tempfile
3.)  Insert this floppy and copy all of the contents to c:\tempfile
4.)  Remove the floppy drive and connect the CD-ROM drive
5.)  Insert the Adaptec CD and follow the setup instructions
6.)  When it asks you to insert your "Adaptec Update Diskette," click on
     the "Browse..." button and type c:\tempfile
7.)  Click on OK.
8.)  After installation is complete, and the system reboots, you can delete
     the files in your c:\tempfile folder if you like.
