0fBOOT METHODS07

The Rescue disk can be used for system recovery as well as for installation.
The methods 0flinux07, 0framdisk07, and 0ffloppy07 will boot you into a small standalone 
root system.  The 0frescue07 method will mount an existing root partition.

0fAvailable boot methods:07
0flinux07
  Start the installation -- this is the default.
0framdisk007 (or 0framdisk107)
  Start installation, load the ramdisk from the first (or the second)
  floppy drive.
0ffloppy007 (or 0ffloppy107)
  Start installation, mount the floppy in the first (or the second)
  floppy drive as root.  This uses less memory.
  If you have only one floppy drive, you cannot load base from
  0ffloppy007, but you can install from other media (CD, harddisk, etc).
0frescue07
  Boot and mount any root filesystem. The root filesystem must be given at
  the prompt, so e.g., type 0frescue root=/dev/hda107.

Press <09ENTER07> or type boot method, arguments, and <09ENTER07> to boot.
Press function key <09F107> for the help index.
