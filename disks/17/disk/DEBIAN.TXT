                  0fWelcome to 0bDebian GNU/Linux 2.20f!07

This is the Debian Rescue disk. Keep it once you have installed your system, 
as you can boot from it to repair the system on your hard disk if that ever
becomes necessary (press <09F307> for details).

On most systems, you can go ahead and press <09ENTER07> to begin installation.
You will probably want to try doing that before you try anything else.  If 
you run into trouble or if you already have questions, press <09F107> for 
quick installation help.

0fWARNING07: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
    proceeding. The installation procedure can completely and 0cirreversibly07
    erase them! If you haven't made backups yet, remove the rescue disk 
    from the drive and press <09RESET07> or <09Control-Alt-Del07> to get back to
    your old system.
