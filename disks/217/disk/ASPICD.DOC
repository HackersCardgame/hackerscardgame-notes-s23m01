Release Note No. 12
Product Name    : ASPICD.SYS/EXE

Release Note No. 11
Product Name    : ASPICD.SYS/EXE
		  DOS ASPI Module for CD-ROM Devices
Version No.     : 3.48
Release Date    : 16th November, 1995

Current version fixes the following bug:

With MPC BATTLE CHESS CD-Game, when the audio option is on, the previous
releases of the driver (V3.47 and below) caused Windows to get locked-up
completely requiring reboot. 

This problem should not be confused with the one solved in V3.46. The former
game runs on DOS and MPC Battle Chess runs on Windows. These two are
different as for as ASPICD was concerned. This necessitated changes in
ASPICD. 

This solution might render the movie jerky in the following case:
Wearnes CDD-110 8-Bit (Not ATAPI ) CD-ROM Drive, EPCD Adapter, EPCD Driver.

A solution to satisfy both the requirements can not be provided. For the
case of Wearnes ASPICD V3.41a through V3.47 is suggested.

Release Note No. 10
Product Name    : ASPICD.SYS/EXE
		  DOS ASPI Module for CD-ROM Devices
Version No.     : 3.47
Release Date    : 5th August, 1995

Additional Feature :

This revision of the CD ROM driver supports PANASONIC PD drives. This
requires the drive to be configured (through jumpers) for LUN mode
operation. The driver does not need any command line switch to enable this
feature.

Release Note No. 9
Product Name    : ASPICD.SYS/EXE
		  DOS ASPI Module for CD-ROM Devices
Version No.     : 3.46
Release Date    : 20th July, 1995

Description of the bug fixed in this release:

With BATTLE CHESS CD-Game (both Rev. 1 and 4), the previous releases of the
driver (V3.45 and below) caused the system to get locked-up completely
requiring reboot.

	The current version fixes this problem.

OBSERVATIONS: Please confirm them from your end.

(a). Although SOUND OFF option was enabled, BATTLE CHESS Game was found to
play audio tracks when two pieces fight.

(b). We also made the following observations regarding Adaptec's ASPICD.SYS
V3.01 when loaded with EPSA.SYS V4.25:

	(1). The audio was muted except during when two pieces fight
	[Obs. (a)] and fight animation was observed to be less.

	(2). Resulted in the display of a garbled screen, when CDMUSIC was
	invoked.

Release Note No. 7
Product Name    : ASPICD.SYS/EXE
		  DOS ASPI Module for CD-ROM Devices
Version No.     : 3.44
Release Date    : 28th April, 1995

Release Features:
	- Multi-session disc support for NEC 3xi, 3xp, 3xpplus, 4xe

		NEC 3xi (500 type).
		It needs to be validated with other models.

	- This version restricts the number of sectors in one ASPI read
	command to less than or equal to 16. This feature was found
	to be required with NEC 3xp, 3xpplus drives, for reliable
	operation in slow modes.
