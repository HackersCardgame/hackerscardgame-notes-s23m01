
    Release notes of EPATHD.EXE/SYS/ADD and EPATSYQ.EXE/SYS
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Release Date    : 12th Jul 1996
    Release Version : 5.23

    Release Notes - 
    (Changes include those made from driver version 5.22)

    1.  In the 5.21 version of the driver, access of illegal
        memory areas was being done in the driver.

        This caused a GP when our drivers were used under OS/2.
        This problem occurs only with the 5.21 Version of the
        driver.

        This has been fixed.

    2. Driver can now handle HD capacities of upto 8Gb.

        Earlier, capacities more than 1.5Gb were not
        feasible with our drivers.

    3. EPAT Plus Support provided in this version.

    4. Pass thru printers like Canon, Deskjet and HP-4L can
       now peacefully co-exist with our drivers.

    5. Junk printing problems have been fixed in this release.

        Connecting a printer to the parallel port and
        initialising the EPATHD driver, will NOT result
        in the printing of junk characters.

    6. Timer based EJECT command for AVATAR drives
    has been implemented in this version of the driver.
    (For DOS Drivers Only)

        This polls for the GET MEDIA STATUS information
        returned from the drive, once in every two seconds
        and issues a DRIVE EJECT command, if a MEDIA CHANGE
        had been requested. 

        Hence the EJECT button will be operational after
        our EPATHD driver is installed.

    7. Format Termination problem, observed with SyQuest
    drives, have been solved in this version of the driver.

        Formatting SyQuest drives with EPATHD/ASPIHDRM

        (a) using HDPREP's FORMAT WITH VERIFY &
        (b) using DOS FORMAT.COM 

        was tested at development level to be fine.

        For this changes have been made in the EPATHD
        driver and in ASPIHDRM.

        This format problem will be solved with any
        combination of EPATHD drivers 5.23 and up
        and ASPIHDRM 4.03 and up.

    8. Ejecting the medium of AVATAR drives, immediately
    after the insertion of a medium, was not possible.
    The medium could however be ejected after doing an
    operation on the drive after reinserting the medium and
    by ejecting for a second time, after operation ceases.
    (For DOS Drivers Only)

        This problem has been corrected.

        Now, the medium can be ejected, as soon as it
        is inserted. However, pressing the eject button
        WILL HAVE NO EFFECT, when there is ongoing operation
        on the drive.

    9. Translation of MEDIA STATUS related error codes
    to SCSI error codes was not proper.

        Proper translation of these error codes
        have been implemented.

    10. Some of the earlier drivers, have problems if apps.
    like SHTLMAN/HDPREP etc. dynamically load the drivers
    when a copy of the ASPI Manager is loaded already.
    (For DOS Drivers Only)

        This has been fixed in this version of the driver.
