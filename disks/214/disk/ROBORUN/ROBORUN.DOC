Attached to this posting in Roborun 2.1, the latest version of roborun.  Thanks
to all for their suggestions.

-Please don't be frustrated if the game seems too difficult to control at
first.  I designed it to reward elegant thinking and execution of strategy, not
reckless pounding of keys.  Remember: the key buffer is ACTIVE, and if you
press a key 10 times, your next 10 turns will be taken.

- Please send more comments and shareware fees to David Liu, 1345 Iverson
Place, Riverside, CA 92506.  I only received 3 shareware fees so far!!!
Although I really enjoy programming and seeing users enjoy my programs, I feel
the $5 is justified in this case given the amount of work.

- Attached to this posting are two other programs: a short version of roborun
2.1 for low-memory users [called ROBORUNS on this disk -jkh-], and a practice
bonus round [called BONUSRND on this disk -jkh-].  The complete Roborun 2.1
[called ROBORUN2 on this disk -jkh-] contains everything but the bonus round
practice program.

Enjoy!!!

After 1.5 hours on the phone from Cambridge, MA, I'm done.  Whew.

Remember: shareware...shareware...

ENJOY! Now you can turn the sound off so it looks like you're doing
work...
