   Version 2.00 - a "Major" release, beta test pre-release


   1. The general compression algorithm has been significantly improved:
      Compression ratio and speed are both improved under normal conditions
      and adapt better to available memory.

   2. A special "multimedia" compression method has been added. It is
      intended primarily to be used when compressing digital audio data and
      graphics (true color bitmaps). An improvement in the compression
      ratio, of up to 30%, can be expected over the normal compression
      algorithm.

      The use of multimedia compression is optional and may be switched on
      by the "Use multimedia compression" item in the configuration menu or
      by the command line switch -mm[f]. RAR performs intelligent data
      analysis and uses the general compression algorithm when multimedia
      compression provides no improvement. Optimum performance occurs when
      different data types are combined in the same archive. The switch
      -m<N> "Set compression method" may also be used with multimedia
      compression.

      When multimedia compression is used for the entire archive (switch off
      data analysis when compressing certain multimedia files), the -mmf
      switch may be used "Force Multimedia Compression".

   3. The OS/2 version of RAR 2.00 contains an option for changing the size
      of the sliding dictionary created when files are compressed. This may
      be set to 64Kb (default), 128Kb, 256Kb, 512Kb or 1Mb and results in a
      corresponding (significant) decrease in the size of the output
      archive, particularly when compressing large files. When compressing
      using a large (more than 64Kb) sliding dictionary, compression time
      will increase.

   4. The RAR 2.00 version for Dos may be used to unpack archives created
      with RAR 2.00 on other platforms (currently OS/2 only) where the
      sliding dictionary size is greater than 64 Kb. As much memory
      (Conventional and EMS) as possible should be made available to the Dos
      version of RAR when unpacking archives created using a large sliding
      dictionary, in order to improve unpacking speed. Archives created with
      a large dictionary cannot be converted to SFX with the default SFX
      module in the Dos version.

   5. Password encryption has been improved.

   6. A Data Recovery facility has been implemented. Optionally, redundant
      information may be added to a RAR archive, incurring a small penalty
      in archive size, which will help to recover archived files in the case
      of floppy disk failure or data losses of any other kind. Use the
      option "Put recovery record" in the configuration or the Alt/F6 key in
      RAR to place the redundant recovery information into a created
      archive. The corresponding command lines switch is -rr[N], where N is
      the number of redundant data sectors (1 to 8). Default values are:

                   Archive size     Number of RR-sectors
                     < 50Kb                   2
                     50Kb-500Kb               4
                     > 500Kb                  8

      A damaged archive may be reconstructed using the "Repair" function of
      RAR (Alt/F8 key combination in RAR or the command line option "r").
      The recovered archive will be named $RECOVER.RAR. If the old, pre-2.00
      repair procedure was used (without data recovery records) or
      recovering was not completed, the reconstructed archive will be named
      $RECONST.RAR.

      The chance of successful archive reconstruction, using recovery
      records, is very high if the size of the continuous portion of damaged
      data is not greater than N*512 bytes, where N is number of RR-sectors
      initially placed into the archive.

   7. RAR 2.00 is compatible with previous releases and handles archives
      created by older versions of RAR. The sole limitation of backward
      compatibility: you will need old external SFX module to convert old
      style archive to SFX or simply build it using RAR 1.5x. Archives
      created with RAR 2.00 cannot be unpacked by older versions of RAR.

   8. RAR 2.00 for DOS determines the current CPU type and uses 386/486 CPU 
      instructions code if possible. This option may be switched on/off
      using the option "Use 386 instructions" in the configuration menu.

   9. The OS/2 version of RAR 2.00 has a new feature "Set task priority and 
      sleep time".  Use Alt/R in full-screen or the switch -ri<P>[:<S>] on 
      the command line to activate this option. 

      The task priority <P> (possible values, 0 to 128) conforms to the
      corresponding OS/2 concept.  Values of <P> are grouped into the
      following groups:

                 <P> value      OS/2 <priority class>:<priority level>
                    0                OS/2 default (i.e. 2:0, or <P>=33)
                   1-32              1:0-1:31
                  33-64              2:0-2:31
                  65-96              3:0-3:31
                  97-128             4:0-4:31

      When <P> is equal to 0, the default OS/2 task priority is used.

      The sleep time <S> is a value from 0 to 1000 (milliseconds). This 
      is the period of time that RAR will give back to OS/2 after every read 
      or write during the packing or unpacking operation.  The sleep time 
      setting is useful when several tasks with the same priority are 
      running in the system.
