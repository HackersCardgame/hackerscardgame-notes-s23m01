                               A Menu-driver for LHARC
			            By:  Rick Hicks
				    


          LHMENU is a menu program to make viewing and working with LHARC 
          very friendly.  In order for LHMENU to function you must
          have Haruyasu Yoshizaki's LHARC.EXE program.
          Please note that these programs are copyrighted and they can be
          obtained from most BBS's.
	  Both files should be in a directory that is part of your
	  PATH statement (see your DOS manual for info on PATH).

          
	  Acknowledgement: This program was developed to follow the same
	  general screen as PKARCM and users of that program will find
	  the same structure and ease of use. I gratefully acknowledge 
	  the author of that fine program.

                          LHMENU VERSION 1.00 USER MANUAL



          QUICK START

          To start-up LHMENU simply enter "LHMENU [d:\path\filespec]".
	  You may specify wild cards in the filespec. If you use wild 
	  cards in the filespec LHMENU will allow operations of LHARC
	  on multiple LHARC files. Upon execution LHMENU will present
	  a Lotus-like menu bar to perform different operations;
	  to [L]ist the files in LHARC files, to [B]rowse files in LHARC 
	  files, to [E]xtract files from LHARC files, to [U]pdate files
	  to LHARC files, to [M]ove files to LHARC files, to [D]elete files
	  from LHARC files, to [T]est the integrity of LHARC files, and to
	  [Q]uit and return to DOS. The arrow keys may be used to 
	  perform the different operations or the first letter of the
	  operation to be performed can be entered.
	  
            

          THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED:

          List Contents of File - L
	      This operation will display on the screen the contents of
	      the LHARC files chosen.
	      
	  Browse a file - B 
              This operation will ask for what files you wish to view.
	      Enter the filenames you wish to view (wildcards accepted,
	      i.e. *.doc) and the contents of the files selected will
	      be shown on the screen.

          Extracting files - E 
              This operation will ask for what files you wish to extract
	      (wildcards also acceptable) and will extract files that 
	      are selected. Extracted files will be placed on the 
	      current disk in the current directory. 
	      
          Update/Add to the file - U
	      This operation will ask for the name of the files you wish
	      to update or add to the current LHARC archive file. Wildcards
	      are again acceptable. If you are creating a new LHARC file
	      the Update/Add operation will create the LHARC file.
	      Example: LHMENU TEST will create a new file called TEST.LZH
	      if the Update/Add operation is performed.
	      
	  Move files to a LHARC file - M
	      This operation will move files to a LHARC archive file,
	      test them for integrity and then delete the original 
	      files from the disk.
	      It will first ask for confirmation that you wish the
	      original files to be deleted and then ask for what
	      files you wish to move. Again, wildcards are acceptable.
	      
	  Delete a file from the LHARC file - D
              This operation will delete the selected files from the
	      LHARC file. Again, wildcards are acceptable.
              	  
	  Testing LHARC file integrity - T
              NOTE: This is currently not supported in the LHARC
	      program. If a future revision to LHARC supports this
	      function, it will be added to LHMENU.
	      
          Quit to DOS - Q
              This operation will exit LHMENU and return operation to
	      the DOS prompt.
