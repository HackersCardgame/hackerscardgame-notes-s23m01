
			Martian terrain renderer
			------------------------

  Here is a small demo to draw fractal voxel-based terrains in real time...

  If you have a 386 or better with VGA graphics, run mars and use the mouse to
move around the landscape. Press any key to quit. A different map is calculated
each time the program is run. This code may form the basis of a forthcoming
game...

  If you have any comments, or would like a general chat about graphics, voxels
or texture-mapping etc, etc, e-mail me at: TJC1005@hermes.cam.ac.uk
